A simple and beautiful website in HTML5 that I've created for the kenyan-tanzanian association here in Moncton, New Brunswick. I was inspired by [Arte's](http://arte.tv) website, an european public television.

### - CSS

* [Eric Meyer's Reset File]() : The reset file is used to properly set up differents HTML components on the same basic. Pretty useful espcially when you care about serving the same user-experience on several browser

* [PureCSS](https://github.com/yahoo/pure/) : a set of small, responsive CSS modules maintend by Yahoo. The stylesheet of the page is mainly based on ,  I like it because specially when it comes to small project. Thus, I modified certain components to fit the needs for the page. 

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) : Serve a sweet experience through various Fonts.

* [Fonts Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) : Very popular set of icons. Highly recommandable in all your projects, instead of using images.

* [Animate On Scroll](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) : stylesheet for the differents effects available. 

### - Javascript

I used few javascript libraries that I found interesting on the web.

* [Jquery]() : unstoppable jquery
* [Animate On Scroll](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) : Small library to animate elements on your page as you scroll.

### - Images

* 100% of the images came from [Flickr](http://flickr.com) under the open source license.

### - Test

At this moment of the project, I did not focus on responsiveness (so that I can test the website on differents screen size)

### - Optimization

Through my little experience, I learnt little tricks to be able to speed up page rendering. I applied the following ones here :
* Compressed the differents images (reduced the size to 1024px max)
* Minified css + js files
* Passed the website through 2 differents code validator [Validator.nu](https://html5.validator.nu/) and [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) : the code complies to the HTML5 standards.
* Others improvments will necessarily be done on server side : js + css caching.
